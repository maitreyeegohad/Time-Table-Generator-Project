# Time-Table-Generator-Project

## Theory
The program can easily be described as a scheduling computing software wherein you input basic data sets and it will output a structured result. A simple input-process-model would be Genetic algorithm is a computing method that natural selection which is a process in biological evolution.
The application takes five major inputs; Instructors, rooms and subjects component supports addition of entry using the application and importation. The sections component allows creation of sections with special feature of sharing subject with other sections and the scenario manager component handles running configuration. There would be two types of output; using the result viewer of the application which can view the top five solutions of the last generated scenario and exporting the selected solution which will produce three comma separated values (CSV) files.

## Problem Definition
Scheduling is being done semi-manually with computer assistance which can produce errors, violations of constraints and inefficiencies noting that scheduling has gone harder with tighter constraint.
